Supervised Learning
- right answer is given in every task
>
- regression is used to predict continuous valued output
>
- classification supervised learning (discrete value if output)
>
Unsuperised learning
>
- no label(answer) in the output and let the computer to find the pattern
>
- clustering algoithm is to group the pattern with similar output
