## Support vector machine
## Optiization Opjective
For the review of logistic regression
```
If y = 1, we want h(x) simliar to 1, and z much greater than 0.
If y = 0, we want h(x) simliar to 0 and z much smaller than 0.
```

So the outcome we want bt using Support vector machine(SVM) is purple line in the graph(a straight line simliar to the cost function curve)

We changed (compare to the logistic function):
1. we cross out 1/m in SVM(as the minimum are the same regardless 1/m)
2. we put the factor to the first term instead of second term
